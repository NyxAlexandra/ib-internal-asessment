### Research Question

How do servers store passwords?

### Aim

- teach readers about the purpose of hashing
- show how an alogithm can be implemented
  - introduce bitwise operations
- show the security of a popular algorithm by calculating
  time to crack the hashed data
- show how security of hashing algorithms is sidestepped
  by bad password habits (like using common passwords and
  the same password for multiple accounts)

### Rationale

Hashing is an important part of many people's lives that
often goes unnoticed. Passwords are a fundamental part
of securing logins.
